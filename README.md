Task:- To Develop a programmatic way of generating an invoice for orders placed on an e-commerce platform

My solution:-
* I have used Custom approach, by which i construct an HTML file that match the required invoice
format, which can accommodate the inputs and the derived parameters.
* I used pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript for generating the invoice.
* For seeing the output of the Html file i.e whether it's able to generate invoice or not, for that purpose,
open the Invoice_Generator.html in any internet browser and by clicking 'Generate PDF' button, it will download
the invoice in pdf format.
